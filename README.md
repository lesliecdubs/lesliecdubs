# Hello, world. I'm Leslie! 👩🏻‍💻

I’m a “front of the frontend” software engineering leader who loves supporting teams working with the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), React, CSS (😍), design systems, and accessibility.

I’m a former co-host of the devchat.tv podcast [React Round Up](https://reactroundup.com/hosts/lesliecohn-wein), and my agency work has been nominated for a Webby and 4x Awwwards. A site I developed in 2018 won the [CommArts Interactive Award](https://www.commarts.com/project/26022/the-parker-palm-springs). I’ve also written for CSS Tricks and LeadDev, and helped grow Netlify's frontend discipline from 2 to 12+ engineers during the startup's early years.

## How did I get here?
The first line of code I ever wrote was for my LiveJournal theme.

I had a college internship building Drupal and WordPress sites for nonprofits; a few years later, I was developing [sites for Nintendo](https://web.archive.org/web/20150312155138/http://nesremix.nintendo.com/) at an NYC ad agency.

As an agency developer, I saw firsthand how the Jamstack would revolutionize the web. I loved it so much that I joined [Netlify](https://netlify.com) in 2018 as employee number 30-something, where I [worked on the React app](https://twitter.com/lesliecdubs/status/1207770216576487425) that powers [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com) and later managed the burgeoning growth engineering team.

In 2022, I went to work on my other favorite dev tool: GitHub. Combining my love of UI, accessibility, and systems thinking, I joined as Director of Design Engineering to support the teams who build the [Primer Design System](https://primer.style/) and bring GitHub's brand to life through [creative code](https://github.blog/2020-12-21-how-we-built-the-github-globe/).

## Other stuff I like
In my spare time, I frequent the [ReactJS Dallas](http://meetup.com/reactjsdallas) and [Women Who Code DFW](https://www.womenwhocode.com/dfw) meetups, volunteer at [Jewish Family Service](https://jfsdallas.org/), teach ninth grade religious school, play board games, host dinner parties, and hang out with my [(chef) spouse Eli](http://www.thejoyfulbelly.com/) and basset hound mix [FBI Agent Burt Macklin](https://www.instagram.com/dammitmacklin/).
