# Hello, world. I'm Leslie! 👩🏻‍💻

I’m a “front of the frontend” developer and manager who loves growing engineers and building pretty, useful stuff. I'm especially into [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), React, CSS (my favorite! 😍), accessibility, and design systems.

I’m a former panelist on the devchat.tv podcast [React Round Up](https://reactroundup.com/hosts/lesliecohn-wein), and my agency work has been nominated for a Webby and 4x Awwwards. A site I developed in 2018 won the [CommArts Interactive Award](https://www.commarts.com/project/26022/the-parker-palm-springs). I’ve also written for CSS Tricks.

## How did I get here?
The first line of code I ever wrote was for my LiveJournal theme. 

I had a college internship building Drupal and WordPress sites for nonprofits; a few years later, I was developing [sites for Nintendo](https://web.archive.org/web/20150312155138/http://nesremix.nintendo.com/) at an NYC ad agency.

## Other stuff I like
In my spare time, I frequent the [ReactJS Dallas](http://meetup.com/reactjsdallas) and [Women Who Code DFW](https://www.womenwhocode.com/dfw) meetups, volunteer at [Jewish Family Service](https://jfsdallas.org/), teach ninth grade religious school, and hang out with my [(chef) spouse](http://www.thejoyfulbelly.com/) and basset hound mix [FBI Agent Burt Macklin](https://www.instagram.com/dammitmacklin/).

- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a hyphenated last name, but neither of those names were ones I was born with!
